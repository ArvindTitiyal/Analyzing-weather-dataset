### Project Overview

 ## Problem Statement

We'll be working with a csv file that contains weather data for each hour in 2012. There are many interesting connections between everyday life and the weather that we will explore with the help of this dataset. Apply all the numpy and pandas skills learned so far to analyze the data.
